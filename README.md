This is the beginning of **Open CRM**: a developer-first, open-source Customer Relationship Management system built for the modern web. The goal is to create a powerful, self-hostable, and beautiful CRM that teams and individuals will love to use.

## The Vision

We are building a CRM that is:

- **Developer-First:** With a clean codebase, modern tooling, and a focus on extensibility, contributing should be a joy.
- **Truly Open-Source:** No paid tiers, no feature-gating. All features will be available under the MIT license. Fork it, customize it, own your data.
- **Modern & Performant:** Leveraging the best of the React and Node.js ecosystems to create a fast, responsive, and reliable user experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started (for Development)

Ready to contribute? Here‚Äôs how to get the project running locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/suryawansh/smart-crm.git
cd open-crm
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

We recommend using `pnpm`.

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file by copying the example.

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

You'll need to provide:

- `DATABASE_URL`: Your PostgreSQL connection string.
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: A secret key for session encryption.

### 4. Set Up the Database

The easiest way to run PostgreSQL locally is with Docker.

```bash
# Start the PostgreSQL container (a docker-compose.yml is included)
docker-compose up -d

# Apply the database schema
pnpm prisma migrate dev
```

### 5. Run the Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

The boilerplate is set up with a logical structure to make development intuitive.

```
/app             # Next.js App Router pages and layouts
/components      # Shared UI components (built with ShadCN UI)
/lib             # Utility functions and shared libraries
/prisma          # Prisma schema, migrations, and seeds
/types           # Global TypeScript type definitions
/middleware.ts   # Middleware for authentication and authorization
